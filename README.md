# MultFYLM-designs
These are files used to create high-resolution photomasks to fabricate the fission yeast lifespan microdissector (FYLM) using photolithography/soft lithography. This permutation of the design allows the fabrication of 6 parallel devices that can be run in tandem, which we call the "MultFYLM" References to the use of both FYLM and MultFYLM can be found in the following papers:
